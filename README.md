In developing the app, several design choices were made to ensure a seamless user experience while incorporating the GPT-3.5-turbo model. Leveraging Next.js 14 as the framework provided a solid foundation for building a dynamic and responsive web application. Tailwind CSS was employed for styling, allowing for rapid development and easy maintenance of a visually appealing interface across various screen sizes.

One of the primary challenges encountered was deciding on the app's design to optimize UI/UX. This involved considering factors such as readability, ease of navigation, and visual appeal. Through iterative design processes and user feedback, a layout that balances aesthetics with functionality was achieved.

Another hurdle was implementing social media sharing functionality without utilizing a backend. Since creating a dynamic page for each response wasn't feasible, a workaround was devised. By using encodeURIComponent, each story generated by the AI model could be encoded into a URL-friendly format, enabling users to easily share their narratives on social platforms.

Integrating the GPT-3.5-turbo model posed its own set of challenges. To accommodate this, a server was created using Next.js. This setup facilitated communication between the frontend and the AI model, allowing users to generate text seamlessly within the application.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
